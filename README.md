# BabyMemoApp

This is a small application that I made with [Monaca](https://monaca.io) for my wife on Christmas Day 2014.

This application counts the days and weeks after the day of our wedding and the day of birth of our baby and allows adding and removing short notes.

Made with technologies such [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org) and [Phonegap](http://phonegap.com).
